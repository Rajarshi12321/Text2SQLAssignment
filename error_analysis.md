### Error Analysis in Text2SQLAssignment

In the Text2SQLAssignment project, error analysis involves several strategies to ensure the accuracy and correctness of generated SQL queries.

1. **Retry Mechanism**:
   - The `process_query` function retries the query generation process up to five times if errors are encountered.
   - Past errors are considered in subsequent retries to improve query generation and minimize syntax errors.

2. **Additional Prompts**:
   - Prompts have been enhanced to `include type` casting and the use of `ILIKE` to reduce syntax errors and improve query accuracy.

3. **Verification of Zero Rows Output**:
   - Analysis of queries resulting in zero rows output confirmed that this is due to no relevant data rather than bad SQL generation.
   - Example: `Find customers who have rented less films this year than last year` <br> Since the last time customers rented films was on `2022-08-23 21:50:12+00`

These strategies ensure robust error handling and improve the overall performance of the Text2SQL conversion process.
